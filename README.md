Repository for homework lesson 6 and additional tasks (Except for the last additional task.)

# Homework0
Create a class CreditCard with the fields account number, current amount on the account. Create one constructor with two parameters.
Add a method that allows you to charge the amount to the credit card. The method takes an amount as input and adds this amount to the current amount. Add a method that allows you to withdraw a certain amount of money from a card. The method takes an amount as input and subtracts this amount from the current amount. Add a method that outputs the current card information. Write a program that creates three objects of the CreditCard class that have an account number and an initial amount.
Test scenario to verify: 
Put money on the first two cards and withdraw money from the third card. 
Display the current state of all three cards.

# Homework1
Create a class to describe a student of our group.
Class fields: first name, last name, passport number, group name (you can add your own fields at will - for example, age).
Create objects of this class for each student of our group.
Put all these objects into an array.
Run a for-each loop through the array and output the information to the console. 

# AdditionalTasks

# BankAccount
The user makes a deposit in the amount of "a" roubles for a period of "years" at 10% per annum (each year the size of his deposit increases by 10%. This money is added to
the amount of the deposit, and the next year it will also bear interest). Write a programme "bank" that takes the arguments "a" and "years" and returns the amount that will be in the user's account.

# RotateArray
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

# TwoSum
Given an array of integers, find two numbers that add up to give the given number. The twoSum function should return the indices of the two numbers so that they add up to the target number.
For example:
Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target = 9.
Output: index1 = 0, index2 = 1.
